# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game, created to practice and enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project provides an engaging game interface where users can play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer, with visual feedback and score tracking.
